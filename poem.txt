They say life is a cycle
Birth, growth, and ultimately, death
Though this cycle may be long,
They teach us to love the time spent in it
But how can I, when all I see is a cycle of work and duties to the world
Years toiling under a blue sky, the sun just out of reach
One of these days I’ll learn to step off the staircase of life
Into the harsh desert away from society
It won’t be the end of a life,
But the beginning of a new one.
